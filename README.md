# C8 as NYC

This package simulates the [nyc package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) by linking [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) at the position of [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc).

## Why should I do that?

[NYC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) is a great tool, but it works not very well with [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and code coverage. 
But [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) does this job and has the same interface as [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc). 
And yes, [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) supports [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8), but the great [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/), 
[PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/phpstorm/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/webstorm/) does only support [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) for coverage in the IDE.

This package solves the problem with IntelliJ IDEs ðŸ˜‰
